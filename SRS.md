## Scope

## User Characteristic

## Technical Enviroment

**Targets:**

- Windows
- Linux
- Macos
  
**Engine/Framework:**

- Custom C# Framework
- OpenGL

**Resoning:**
  
  I have chosen Windows, Macos and Linux with OpenGL to provide as much crossplatform support as possible within reson.

  Linux and Macos are priority as they are my primary development platforms and it would be pointless developing on a platform that can't be used to debug / test.

  I have chosen to use my own c# custom framework as it will reduce development time, allowing for faster itteration and debugging due to
  being familar with C# as the language I use for development the most and having written the framework.
